# Logbook - Devops group A 

## Meeting 07/02/25 

Group worked on converting minitwit.py into a simple c# program using scriban templates. And worked on the Docker exercises for the week

## Meeting 09/02/25 

After the work during the last meeting the group encountered issues with loading the users in the simple c# project. Because of this it was decided to convert it to a dotnet project using efcore to handle the users. 

The group still had issus loading the scriban template files having issues getting the template files to be rendered as html in browser instead of text files.

## Meeting 10/02/25
After the issues the previous meeting the group decided to migrate the simple c# solution into a dotnet web application using razor pages to handle the UI elements. 

Group worked with converting the application to razor pages. In order to keep the project structure simple, for now we opted to forgo the repositiory pattern and just keep the LINQ statements within the razor-page-models
